Hello! I am a physicist with a keen interest in material design. I use machine learning, numerical simulations, and statistical mechanics to identify descriptors that make material design easier. We found several intriguing descriptors, including [coarse-grained sequence patterns](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsfoodscitech.2c00251), [equations](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0053931), and [reduced vector embeddings](https://doi.org/10.1039/D3BM00412K). If that sounds interesting, check out my papers in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=vg7M8DoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)! And here is (my [CV](https://arghyadutta.github.io/cv-arghya.pdf)).

Here, you will find code used in my papers, some visualization and coding guides, a LaTeX template, and links to many useful resources. Take a look!
